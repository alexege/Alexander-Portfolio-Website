            I am a Computer Engineer from Chicago, Illinois. 
            I attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale, where I earned my bachelors' of Science in Computer Engineering. 
            After graduating in December of 2015, I began working as a Technical Rotation Associate for Trend Micro.
            Since then, I have moved to Southern California where I have attended a Coding Bootcamp I recently graduated from.
            I am now working as a TA and hope to continue my learning as I go.
